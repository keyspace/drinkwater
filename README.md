[h1]Intro[/h1]

Three new stat mechanics are added to the game: Water, Food and Sleep.

To restore food and water stats you have to use consumable items, like Clang Kola and Cosmic Coffee.
4 new consumable items are added: Water, Beer and two kinds of potato chips.
You can buy these items in the economy station, or find them in a drop pod.
Water can is also producible in assembler, using iron and ice.
You can get some sleep by sitting in a non controllable seat (slowly), laying in the bed or cryo chamber (fast) or just drinking Coffee.


[h1]For modders[/h1]

This mod uses vanilla stat mechanics, which makes it very easy to integrate with this mod. 
All you have to do in your own mod is to create consumable items that restores either "Food", "Water" or "Sleep" stats. No changes in this mod is required. 

If there are any issues integrating, please let me know.
